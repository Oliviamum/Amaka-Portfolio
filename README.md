A Personal Portfolio using Bootstrap to build

Short description explaining the what, why, and how of the project: 
This project is part of the requirement for the fufillment of the bootcamp project.
It is also a practice and demonstration of my understanding of the workings of Bootstrap applications.
Although bootstrap makes webdesign building easy, a creative person would easily see some shortfalls of bootstrap and will have to keep overiding some of the commands to achieve a very special creative design.
This means that bootstrap has its own advantage and disadvantage. however understanding the use of bootsrap and manipulating it is very important to designs.

 It is important for me to work on this project in preparation of building my own project for showcase to emplyers while seeking a job in front end web designing. The project requires me to display my skills and what i have learnt in web site building/design.

Motivation? I am excited to continue learning html, CSS and Javascripts. These are not only good for webdevelopment but they are skills when learnt will be used in a lot of different areas in academics and also business. I am also learning to become a web developer as these are essentials skills for it. 

The reason i built this project? To praticalize what we have learnt in the module 3 such as the HTML, bootstrap and CSS and a bit of Javascript.

Problem solved? It solves the problem of web page accesibility and opening me up more to the various aspects of web design and creativity.

What i learnt? I learnt how to use bootstrap in designing a web page, manipulating the boostrap already given designs for my own desired outcomes, getting better with CSS and also learning how to practice web designing. 

User Story AS an upcoming web designer, I want a website that showcase my work so that its easy to search on the web and see my worth and get a good job in IT.
